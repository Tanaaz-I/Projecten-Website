            <h2>Cyberbullying</h2>
            <p>Online harassment can feel endless because messages, posts, and DMs follow you home. It raises stress and sleep problems and can push people to isolate themselves. Save evidence, report it in the app, block accounts, and tell a trusted adult. Avoid replying in anger — it often escalates the abuse and may have legal consequences.</p>

          <article id="misinformation" class="info-section">
            <h2>Misinformation</h2>
            <p>False claims spread quickly in group chats and reels; once you see them, they can stick even after correction. Before sharing, check the date, source, and author; compare at least three reputable outlets, and watch for emotionally manipulative headlines. For images or videos, use reverse image search and look for AI artifacts like odd hands, earrings, or lighting.</p>

          <article id="privacy" class="info-section">
            <h2>Privacy</h2>
            <p>Apps collect location, contacts, and behavior to build detailed profiles that can be shared, sold, or breached. Protect yourself with unique passwords and a password manager, enable two-factor authentication, review app permissions regularly, and keep accounts private. Think long term before posting; once public, content can be copied forever.</p>

          <article id="social-media" class="info-section">
            <h2>Social media</h2>
            <p>Infinite scroll and constant notifications compete for attention, which can reduce focus, increase anxiety, and disrupt sleep. Curate your feed, mute nonessential alerts, schedule screen-free times (especially before bed), and use app limits or “Do Not Disturb” during study blocks to protect your concentration and mood.</p>

          <article id="ai-generated" class="info-section">
            <h2>AI-generated content</h2>
            <p>Deepfakes, voice clones, and AI-written posts can look real while spreading scams or reputational harm. Treat sensational claims with skepticism, verify with primary sources, and be careful with links and downloads. For visuals, check reflections and small details; for text, look for missing citations or invented quotes.</p>
